  <p>Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s and now maintained by Oracle Corporation. It is widely used in enterprise-level applications, Android app development, and large-scale systems. Java’s most prominent feature is its platform independence—meaning that once a program is written and compiled, it can run on any device that has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.</p>

      <header><h2>Getting Started</h2></header>
      <p id="smallP">This section helps you get started with the basics.</p>
<p>To start programming in Java, developers need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the compiler (javac), the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and necessary libraries. After installing the JDK, an integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code can be used to write and run Java code. A basic understanding of terminal commands or command prompt is also helpful when compiling and executing Java programs manually.

 <code>let x = 10;</code><br>
  <code>function greet(name) { return "Hello " + name; }</code><br>
  <code>const data = await fetchData();</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Syntax">
      <header><h2>Basic Syntax</h2></header>
      <p id="smallP">Here we explain the core syntax of the language or tool.</p>
  <p>Java programs are written using a specific syntax that includes classes, methods, and statements. Every Java program starts with a class and contains a main() method, which serves as the entry point of the application. Java is case-sensitive, requires semicolons at the end of each statement, and uses braces {} to define code blocks. Common data types include int, double, boolean, and String. Java supports both single-line (//) and multi-line (/* ... */) comments, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Advanced_Topics">
      <header><h2>Advanced Topics</h2></header>
      <p id="smallP">Advanced use cases and deeper understanding are provided here.</p>
  <p>As developers progress in Java, they encounter advanced concepts like object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Java also supports multi-threading, allowing developers to build concurrent applications. The Collections Framework provides efficient data structures like ArrayList, HashMap, and TreeSet. Java is also used to build web applications through technologies like JSP, Servlets, and Spring Framework. Additionally, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) allows for seamless interaction with relational databases, and exception handling in Java ensures that programs run smoothly even when unexpected errors occur.</p>
